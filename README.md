# get_next_line42

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.

You will compile the code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):

- cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
