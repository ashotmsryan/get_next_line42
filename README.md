# get_next_line42

This project will not only allow me to add a very convenient function to my collection,
but it will also make me learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables. It is a crucial exercise designed to enhance file reading capabilities and also
project challenges students to create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor,
allowing for efficient and dynamic handling of varying line lengths. The goal is to provide
a reliable and reusable solution for reading text from files while efficiently managing memory.
This project encourages a deeper understanding of file I/O operations and memory management
in the C language

You can compile the code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):

- cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
